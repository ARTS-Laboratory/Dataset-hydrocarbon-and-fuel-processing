# Dataset time domain NMR hydrocarbon and fuel relaxometry

This dataset contains T2 relaxation curves probed from both pure hydrocarbon and jet fuel samples. The relaxation curves were acquired using a time domain nuclear magnetic resonance (TD-NMR) system located at the University of South Carolina, Columbia, USA [1]. The derived cetane number (DCN) of all samples is also provided.
